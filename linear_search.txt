# excersise 2.1-3 p.22
Input: A sequence of n numbers A = {a1, a2, a3, ..., an} and a value v.
Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v. 
Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. 
Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

pseudocode:
for i = 0 to (A.length - 1)
    if A[i] = v
        return i
return 'NIL'

loop invariant:

initialization: 
maintenance:
termination:
